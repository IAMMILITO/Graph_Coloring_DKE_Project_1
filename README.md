# Project-1
DKE Project 1: A challenge for optimal graph colorings. A graph is a set of vertices that may be connected by one or more edges to other vertices in the graph. In this project, all edges in all graphs are bi-directional.
Graph coloring is an NP-hard problem, meaning in layman's terms that the optimal coloring is computationally difficult, and scales exponentially as the size of the graph grows. 

This project accepts a graph in the form of a .csv file
